# AI Coding Guidelines

This project uses iterative development driven by `devChecklist.yaml`.
Follow these rules when contributing:

- Review `devChecklist.yaml` to understand current tasks.
- After completing work, update the relevant task statuses in `devChecklist.yaml`.
- If a task remains `In Progress`, add a `comment` field describing next steps for the
  following developer. Remove outdated comments when marking a task `Done`.
- Adhere to PEP 8 style and include type hints where possible.
- Run `pytest` after making changes and document the results in your final report.
- Ensure the working tree is clean and all tests pass before finishing.
- When recapping completed work, list phases, tasks, subtasks, and their statuses as bullet points.
